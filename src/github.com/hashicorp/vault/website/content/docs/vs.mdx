# Versus Other Software

Although we used to publish information about Vault versus other software, we
no longer do. Partly this is because the information grew exceedingly
out-of-date as Vault gained new functionality and features. More importantly,
just as we like to present information about Vault and its capabilities in the
ways that we prefer, we felt it wasn't appropriate to describe the capabilities
of other projects or products in ways other than their own terms. As a result,
we have decided to remove this section; please consult other projects or
products for information on how they might meet your needs, and use our
documentation or product pages to understand how Vault might meet your needs.
