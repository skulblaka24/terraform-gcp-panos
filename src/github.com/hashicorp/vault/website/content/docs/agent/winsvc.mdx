# Vault Agent Windows Service

Vault Agent can be run as a Windows service. In order to do this, you need to register Vault Agent with the Windows
Service Control Manager using `sc.exe`. After Vault Agent is registered, it can be started like any other Windows
service.

**Note:** These commands should be run in a PowerShell session with Administrator capabilities.

## Register Vault Agent as a Windows service

Use the [`sc.exe`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-create) program
to create a service called "Vault Agent". The `binPath` argument should include the fully qualified path to the Vault
executable, as well as any arguments required.

```shell-session
PS C:\Windows\system32> sc.exe create "Vault Agent" binPath= "C:\vault\vault.exe agent -config=\"C:\vault\agent-config.hcl\""
[SC] CreateService SUCCESS
```

Note that the spacing after the `=` in `binPath=` is intentional.

If you receive a success message, your service is registered with the service manager.

If you get an error, please verify the path to the binary and check the arguments, by running the contents of
`binPath=` directly in a PowerShell session and observing the results.

## Start the Vault Agent service

You have two ways to start the service.

- Using the `sc.exe` command.
- Go to the Windows Service Manager, and look for **Vault Agent** in the service name column. Click the
  `Start` button to start the service.

### Example starting Vault Agent using sc.exe

```shell-session
PS C:\Windows\system32> sc.exe start "Vault Agent"

SERVICE_NAME: Vault Agent
      TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
      STATE              : 4  RUNNING
                              (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, ACCEPTS_SHUTDOWN)
      WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
      SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
      CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
      WAIT_HINT          : 0x0
      PID                : 6548
      FLAGS              :
```
